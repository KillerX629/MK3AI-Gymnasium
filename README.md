# Reinforcement Learning for Mortal Kombat 3 - Ultimate

This is a project that trains an RL agent to play Mortal Kombat 3 - Ultimate using the OpenAI Gymnasium library and the PyTorch framework.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI Gymnasium library
- PyTorch framework
- Mortal Kombat 3 - Ultimate game ROM (not included)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mk3-rl.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

3. Download the Mortal Kombat 3 - Ultimate game ROM and place it in the `roms` directory.

## Usage

To train the RL agent, run the following command:

python train.py

arduino
Copy code

This will start the training process and save the trained model in the `models` directory.

To test the RL agent, run the following command:

python test.py

less
Copy code

This will load the trained model and start playing the game using the learned policy.
